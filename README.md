# Pixel-Visualizer
The  contemporary issue at the heart of the "Pixel Visualizer" project lies in the growing  demand for advanced tools and solutions to address the challenges posed by the  overwhelming volume of digital images and their complex analysis. 

The process of classification involves categorizing a digital 
image by assigning each pixel to one of several land cover 
classes or themes. This categorization is utilized to create 
thematic maps representing the current land cover in an image, 
as suggested by Lillesand and Kiefer in 1994. Typically, 
multispectral data is employed for classification, with the 
spectral patterns present in the data for each pixel forming the 
basis for numerical classification. The primary goal of image 
classification is to identify and represent the features in an 
image, such as unique grey levels or colours, in terms of the 
type or objects of land cover they represent on the ground. 
Image classification is a crucial aspect of digital image 
analysis.
